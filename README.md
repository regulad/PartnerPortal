#### 2024-2025 Weekend Project #2

Hey, I'm Parker. I'm a high school student and I write apps in my free time. Currently, I've been trying (and failing)
to keep an Android addition at bay, so this weekend's project is another Android app.

# Partner Portal

Partner Portal is an open-source and self-hostable 1-on-1 video chat app. It's designed to run 24/7, perfect for you and
your domestic partner to leave in the corner of your college dorm room or apartment.
